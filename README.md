# Performance Optimization of Cloud-Native CI/CD Pipelines: A Comparative Study of GitOps and Traditional Approaches

## Overview

This project compares the performance of traditional CI/CD pipelines (using Jenkins) versus modern GitOps pipelines (using ArgoCD) in cloud-native environments. The goal is simple: **find out which approach delivers faster, more reliable, and more scalable software deploymentsâ€”using real implementation and actual performance metrics.**





# CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using Kubernetes, GitLab, Helm, ArgoCD, Prometheus, and Grafana. The pipeline automates the deployment of applications in a Kubernetes cluster, with monitoring and visualization tools to ensure smooth operations.

## Overview
The pipeline automates the deployment of applications in a Kubernetes cluster, with monitoring and visualization tools to ensure smooth operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration of containerized applications.
- **Helm**: Package management for Kubernetes.
- **GitLab**: Version control and CI/CD pipeline management.
- **ArgoCD**: Continuous deployment tool for Kubernetes.
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring system for collecting metrics.
- **Grafana**: Visualization tool for metrics collected by Prometheus.


## Project Structure

- **`ansible/`**: Ansible playbooks and inventory files for automating the setup of the Kubernetes cluster and adding worker nodes.
- **`application/`**: Source code, Dockerfile, and configuration files for the application to be deployed.
- **`argocd/`**: Configuration files for ArgoCD to manage continuous deployment of the application on Kubernetes.
- **`kubernetes/`**: Scripts for setting up the Kubernetes cluster, including master and worker nodes.
- **`manifests/`**: Kubernetes manifests and Helm chart configurations for deploying the application.
- **`prometheus-grafana/`**: Setting up prometheus and grafana.
- **`.gitlab-ci.yml`**: GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration file.

## Key Components

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**
   - Provisioned using tools like `kubeadm.
   -
   - Managed using Ansible for automated deployment and scaling.

2. **GitLab**
   - Repository for version control.
   - CI/CD pipeline configured in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

3. **Helm**
   - Used for managing Kubernetes applications with Helm charts.

4. **ArgoCD**
   - Continuous deployment tool integrated with the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Automatically syncs with the GitLab repository to deploy updates.

5. **Prometheus and Grafana**
   - Prometheus collects metrics from the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Grafana visualizes these metrics for monitoring.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- A Kubernetes cluster with at least one master node and one worker node.
- Helm installed on your local machine.
- A GitLab repository.
- ArgoCD installed in the Kubernetes cluster.
- Prometheus and Grafana installed for monitoring.
- Access to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitLab Container Registry).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Set Up Kubernetes Cluster**
   - Provision a Kubernetes cluster with at least one master node and one worker node
   - Use `kubeadm` for provisioning.
   - Scripts are available in the kubernetes/ directory.
   - Automate setup with Ansible (`ansible/` directory).

2. **Install Helm**
   - Follow instructions in the Helm documentation to install Helm on your local machine.
     https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

3. **Configure GitLab Repository**
   - Set up repository and CI/CD pipeline (`.gitlab-ci.yml`).

4. **Deploy ArgoCD**
   - Install ArgoCD in the Kubernetes cluster and connect it to your GitLab repository (`argocd/` directory).
   - Scripts are available in the argocd/` directory
5. **Install Prometheus and Grafana**

   - Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using Helm to monitor your Kubernetes cluster.

## Monitoring and Management

- Access Grafana to view real-time metrics from Prometheus.
- Use ArgoCD's UI to manage and visualize application deployments.

## Automate with Ansible
Install Ansible
Install Ansible on your control machine. Ansible will be used to automate the management of your Kubernetes cluster.

1. **Set Up Ansible Inventory**
- Prepare an inventory file that lists your Kubernetes cluster nodes.
- How can we write inventory.ini file follow the (`ansible/` directory)

2. **Run Ansible Playbooks**
- Use the provided Ansible playbooks to automate the setup and management of Kubernetes components on your cluster nodes.
- How can we write ansible playbooks follow the (`ansible/` directory)
